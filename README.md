# Photocell
**WORK IN PROGRESS!**

## Overview

Photocells are sensors that allow us to measure light. This repository will provide useful (to me anyhow) utility C and Python source code for using photocells with IoT micro controllers such as Arduino and Micropython.

## Driver Template

* Convert: Resistance -> Volts -> ADC n-bit integer -> Lux/K

## CdS Photocells
